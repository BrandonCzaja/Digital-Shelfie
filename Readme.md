My app is geared towards board gamers. It is a way for them to show off their collection to friends, but also allows them to update their collection. 



Technology Used: 
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.20.0",
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "connect-mongo": "^3.2.0",
    "cross-env": "^7.0.2",
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-react-views": "^0.11.0",
    "express-session": "^1.17.1",
    "method-override": "^3.0.0",
    "mongoose": "^5.10.6",
    "morgan": "^1.10.0",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.4",
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
  },


For now it is a simple INDUCES CRUD application. Users can signup, login, and logout. They can also add games to different accounts and insert image URLs to go along with them. In later iterations of the app I will be adding API search functionality that will give users the ability to search for games and add them to their collection along with additional details such as: number of players, rules, play time, MSRP, etc. I will eventually add a separate wishlist page for users to add games that they don't currently have but want to get. I may also add a number of times a certain play has won vs other plays, and how many times players have played the game.


I do not plan on adding purchasing functionality.
