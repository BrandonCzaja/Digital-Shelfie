# Concept

My app is geared towards board gamers. It is a way for them to show off their collection to friends, but also allows them to update their collection.

It is a full CRUD application that allows users to add images of their board games along with other game data.

# Technology Used:

- React
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Mongoose / Mongo
- Express
- GitHub
- Heroku
- CSS
- HTML
