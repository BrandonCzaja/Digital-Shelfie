My app is functionally based on the videos that Alex posted in the class channel. 

Originally I was doing on my own but then ran into some big issues with MongoDB. I kept running into the same Mongo Error 11000 "duplicate key" issue every single time I tried a build, even during this final build. I had to restart my build multiple times, which is why I ended up using the videos as a template.

For now it is a simple INDUCES CRUD application. I can add games to different accounts and insert image URLs to go along with them. I will eventually build it out more to include a board game api that allows users to search for games, get an image and other details about the game.
